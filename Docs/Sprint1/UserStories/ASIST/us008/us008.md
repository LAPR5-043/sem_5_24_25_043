# As a system administrator I want to use on the Linux system the PAM module "pam_cracklib.so" to force users to have a complex password. The understanding of complex should be explained in the answer to this user story.

In Linux, you can define a password policy using the `pam_cracklib.so` module, which is part of the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) system. This module enforces password strength requirements and can be configured to ensure that users choose secure passwords.

## Steps to Define a Password Policy

### **1. Edit the PAM Configuration File**
The PAM configuration for password policies is typically found in `/etc/pam.d/common-password`.




    sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password


### **2. Add the `pam_cracklib.so` Line**
Add the line that references `pam_cracklib.so` to set your desired password policy. The syntax looks like this:


    password requisite pam_cracklib.so options


Here are some the options we used:

- `minlen=8` for a minimum length of `8` characters
- `dcredit=-1` for at least `1` digit
- `ucredit=-1` for at least `1` uppercase letter
- `lcredit=-1` for at least `1` lowercase letter
- `ocredit=-1` for at least `1` special character
- `retry=3`: Allow the user to retry `3` times if they fail to meet the policy

Configuration prompt:


    password requisite pam_cracklib.so minlen=8 dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 ocredit=-1 lcredit=-1 retry=3


**Our policy enforces**:
- A minimum password length of 8 characters.
- At least 1 digit, 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 special character.
- Users can retry 3 times if they fail to meet the policy.

### **3. Test the New Password Policy**
After editing the PAM configuration, we test the password policy by changing a user's password with the `passwd` command:


    passwd username


This configuration ensures that users follow a strong password policy when changing their passwords.
