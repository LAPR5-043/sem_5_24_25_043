# US 5.1.18

## 1. Context

*This is a new feature that allows the doctor to remove an operation requisition.*

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.18** As a Doctor, I want to remove an operation requisition, so that the healthcare activities are provided as necessary.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 5118.1. Doctors can delete operation requests they created if the operation has not yet been scheduled.

- 5118.2. A confirmation prompt is displayed before deletion.

- 5118.3. Once deleted, the operation request is removed from the patientâ€™s medical record and cannot be recovered.

- 5118.4. The system notifies the Planning Module and updates any schedules that were relying on this request.

**Dependencies/References:**

*Regarding this requirement we understand that it relates to the planning module, as it needs to be notified and updated. It also has a dependency to US 5.1.19 because the Doctor needs to select the operation request to delete.*
